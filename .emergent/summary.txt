The AI engineer successfully built the Cc (Culturisk Calendar) application, initially as a PWA, despite the original request specifying a native Android app. This pivot was clarified and approved by the user. The development progressed through backend setup (FastAPI, MongoDB), frontend PWA implementation (React, Tailwind, PWA features, custom branding), and core feature development including onboarding, task management, explore section with Google Maps, and a persona system. Monetization via a 3-day free trial and PayPal integration was also implemented.

Following initial completion, the user requested significant enhancements, transforming the app into a comprehensive calendar with advanced scheduling and event recommendations. The AI engineer then addressed a critical security vulnerability: a publicly exposed Google Maps API key, implementing remediation steps and providing detailed user instructions. Finally, the AI engineer began converting the React PWA into a downloadable Android APK using Capacitor but encountered environment setup issues (missing Java, Android SDK). The work concludes with the AI engineer attempting to set up the Android SDK after a system reinitialization due to memory limits.

<product_requirements>
The initial request was for Cc (Culturisk Calendar) v1, a quirky, culture-centric Android app, functional, lightweight, and monetizable. Core features included onboarding (profile, persona choice, permissions), tasks (add/edit, Plan My Day timeline, SQLite storage), minimal explore (Google Maps Places API for 3-5 nearby spots), static template-based persona system, notifications (daily plan, pre-task, explore nudges), and payments (3-day free trial, PayPal SDK, .99 monthly/9.99 annual subscription). Key technologies: Native Android (Kotlin/Jetpack Compose) or Flutter, SQLite, Google Maps API, PayPal SDK.

Later, the user requested an enhanced calendar interface, specifying city/country timezone selection, a comprehensive calendar view as the main interface, advanced task management (timer, deadlines, reminders), integration with Google Calendar, recommendations for nearby events, famous dates, holidays, cultural events, nearby businesses, and user profile-based recommendations. The final request was to convert the web application into a downloadable Android APK.

- **/app/backend/.env**: Environment variables for the backend.
  - **Summary**: Stores  and .
  - **Changes**: Updated to include  (though later flagged for public exposure).
- **/app/backend/.env.example**: Example environment file for backend.
  - **Summary**: Provides a template for backend environment variables without exposing sensitive data.
  - **Changes**: Created during security remediation.
- **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: Main React component.
  - **Summary**: Manages the main application flow, including authentication context, routing between onboarding, main app, and paywall, and now integrates Capacitor features.
  - **Changes**: Initial setup for branding, integration of , , . Later updated to use Capacitor features and fixed a  redeclaration error.
- **/app/frontend/src/components/OnboardingScreen.js**: Handles user onboarding.
  - **Summary**: Collects user profile information and guides through persona selection.
  - **Changes**: Updated to allow city/country selection for timezone instead of just UTC.
- **/app/frontend/src/components/CalendarView.js**: New component for the comprehensive calendar interface.
  - **Summary**: Displays tasks and events in a calendar format, a central part of the enhanced app.
  - **Changes**: Newly created to implement the user's request for a full calendar view.
- **/app/frontend/src/components/TaskModal.js**: New component for detailed task management.
  - **Summary**: Provides UI for adding/editing tasks with timer, deadlines, and reminders.
  - **Changes**: Newly created for enhanced task management features.
- **/app/frontend/public/index.html**: Entry point for the React PWA.
  - **Summary**: Standard HTML file that loads the React app.
  - **Changes**: Created after initial frontend setup failed due to its absence.
- **/app/frontend/capacitor.config.json**: Capacitor configuration file.
  - **Summary**: Defines the Capacitor app ID, name, and web directory, essential for converting the PWA to a native app.
  - **Changes**: Created and configured for the Android conversion.
- **/app/frontend/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml**: Android application manifest.
  - **Summary**: Declares app permissions and components for the Android platform.
  - **Changes**: Modified to add necessary permissions for internet, calendar, and location for the Capacitor-wrapped app.
- **/app/ANDROID_CONVERSION_GUIDE.md**: Markdown file explaining Android conversion steps.
  - **Summary**: Created as an alternative approach when direct APK build faced environment challenges. Provides instructions for manual conversion.
  - **Changes**: Newly created.

<pending_tasks>
- Complete the conversion of the React PWA to a downloadable Android APK. This involves setting up the Android SDK and building the APK using Capacitor.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The current work involves converting the React PWA into a downloadable Android APK using Capacitor. The AI engineer has already:
1.  Installed Capacitor and related plugins in the frontend.
2.  Initialized Capacitor and configured .
3.  Built the React application (yarn run v1.22.22
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run for documentation about this command.) successfully after fixing a missing import in .
4.  Added the Android platform to the Capacitor project ().
5.  Configured Android project resources (, ) and updated  with necessary permissions (internet, calendar, location).
6.  Created a  script and a  hook, and updated  to utilize Capacitor features.
7.  Attempted to build the Android APK, but encountered issues with missing Java and Android SDK.
8.  Installed  and successfully downloaded the Android command-line tools ().

The work paused at extracting and setting up the downloaded Android SDK after a system reinitialization due to memory limits. The product currently has an enhanced calendar interface with onboarding, task management, explore, persona features, and PayPal integration, all running as a PWA, but the Android APK is not yet generated.

<optional_next_step>
Extract the downloaded Android command-line tools and proceed with setting up the Android SDK to enable the Capacitor Android build.
